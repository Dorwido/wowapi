About
======
I am using a python framework for my website and due the current python modules for the WoW Api are not updated very often,
still missing features and I prefer to get raw data, I wrote my own little module.

| It supports: gzip compression and also If-Modified-Since header

*It dont have authentication at the moment, this is because I don't have a API Key*
